## Instructions
The exam is oral and each group will have 30 minutes (sharp) to present their project and 30 minutes to reply to the instructors' questions. All the members of a group must be present during the whole presentation of their group. The presentation can be delivered by multiple people.

 
The presentation should explain what does the project do (what did you build? What problem does it solve?), the design of the project (e.g., how did you organize your code? What modules did you create and what is their relationship?), and show a live demo of the project (it is ok to fix bugs in your project after the submission on the 18th -- just do not add new features).
In the 30 minutes slot for questions the instructors will ask various question about the project (e.g., how did you managed the communication in the project?).
